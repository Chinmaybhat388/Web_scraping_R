# Web_scraping_R
Web scraping bike data from an E store for analytical use case.

Canyon bikes is a German bicycle manufacturer with an online store. We need to obtain data about the various categories
of cycles available in the store,their price, their description, and names in order to perform visualization/analytics.

The project was executed using R programming language and popular libraries for web scraping "Rvest".
